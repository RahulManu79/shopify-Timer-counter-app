Countdown Timer + Analytics — Shopify App Sample Project PRD
1. Introduction
Purpose of the Document: This document outlines the product requirements for a Shopify app that allows merchants to add a countdown timer for special promotions and discounts on their product pages.
Intended Audience: This document is intended for the development team, project manager, and stakeholders involved in the development of the discount countdown timer Shopify app.
Project Scope: The scope of this project is to develop a Shopify app that allows merchants to create and display countdown timers for promotions and discounts on their product pages.
2. Overall Description
Product Perspective: The product is a standalone Shopify app.
Product Features: The app will allow merchants to create different countdown timers for promotions and discounts.
User Classes and Characteristics: The primary users of this app are Shopify merchants who want to create urgency and encourage customers to make purchases by displaying a countdown timer for special promotions.
Operating Environment: The app will operate within the Shopify platform and will interact with the merchant's Shopify admin panel and storefront.
Design and Implementation Constraints: The app must be developed using the MERN stack and Shopify CLI 3.0 and use latest Shopify polaris UI components and guidelines
3. User Stories
As a merchant, I want to create countdown timers with start/end dates so promotions activate automatically.
As a merchant, I want to create evergreen timers (user-session based, resets per visitor) for persistent urgency.
As a merchant, I want to assign timers to specific products, collections, or all products.
As a merchant, I want to customize timer appearance (colors, position, text) to match my brand.
As a merchant, I want to see basic analytics (impressions count) for my timers.
As a merchant, I want visual urgency cues when timers are close to expiring.
4. System Features
4.1 Timer Types (Required)
Fixed Timer: Specific start and end datetime (all users see same countdown)
Evergreen Timer: Session-based timer that starts when user first visits (stored in localStorage), resets after expiry or session end
4.2 Timer Targeting
Apply timer to: All products / Specific products / Specific collections
Use Shopify Resource Picker for product/collection selection
4.3 Data Architecture
Design a MongoDB schema that efficiently handles:
Multi-tenant data isolation (multiple stores)
Timer configurations with targeting rules
Basic analytics tracking (impression counts)
4.4 Client-Side App (Admin)
Dashboard showing all timers with status (active/scheduled/expired)
Timer creation/edit form with validation
Product/Collection picker integration
Basic analytics display per timer
4.5 Widget-Side App (Storefront)
Lightweight Preact widget (~15KB max gzipped target)
Efficient polling/caching strategy for timer data
Handle edge cases: expired timers, no active timers, network failures
Smooth countdown animation without layout shifts
The widget-side app will fetch the timer's JSON data from the server and display the countdown timer prominently on the product page.
4.6 API Design
Design RESTful APIs with:
Proper error handling and HTTP status codes
Input validation and sanitization
Rate limiting consideration (document your approach)
5. Technical Requirements
5.1 Architecture
Use Theme App Extension (not ScriptTag)
Widget should load timer config via a single optimized API call
Implement proper caching headers for timer data
Document your architecture decisions in a brief README section
5.2 Code Quality (Mandatory)
javascript: Use javascript for at least the backend
Testing: Minimum 5 meaningful unit tests covering critical business logic
Error Handling: Graceful degradation—widget should never break the storefront
Linting: ESLint configuration with consistent code style
5.3 Performance Requirements
Widget bundle: Target <30KB gzipped
API response time: <200ms for timer fetch
No Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) from timer injection
Document any performance optimizations made
5.4 Security Requirements
Validate shop ownership on all API calls
Sanitize all user inputs (XSS prevention)
No sensitive data exposure in client-side code
6. Wireframes
Refer to the wireframe diagram of the app working model:

9. Prerequisite Setup for Shopify App
To set up the Shopify app, please follow these steps:
Create a Shopify Partners account by visiting the Shopify Partners website (https://www.shopify.com/partners).
Once you have created your Shopify Partners account, log in and navigate to the "Apps" section.
Click on "Create App" to create a new Shopify app.
Fill in the required information for your app, including the app name, developer email, and URL.
After creating the app, you will receive API keys and credentials that will be used for authentication and API access.
Also, create a new development store from the partners’ dashboard and import a few products to be displayed in the store.
Sample products CSV link: https://github.com/shopifypartners/product-csvs/blob/master/home-and-garden.csv
Use Shopify CLI 3.0 to set up the project locally for your Shopify app.
Refer to Shopify developer docs for tutorials or API docs: https://shopify.dev/docs
Create the app using Shopify CLI and use Shopify's official node-express template:

NOTE: Never miss the deadlines, submit it before the deadline and inform your HR Manager.
